*History:

A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. 
The two-symbol system used is often "0" and "1" from the binary number system. 
The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc. 
For example, a binary string of eight bits can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, 
	represent a wide variety of different items.
