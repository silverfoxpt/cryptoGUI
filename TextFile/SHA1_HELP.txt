* History:

In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and produces a 
	160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. 
It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.

Since 2005, SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents; as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement.
NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 and disallowed its use for digital signatures in 2013. 

As of 2020, chosen-prefix attacks against SHA-1 are practical. 
As such, it is recommended to remove SHA-1 from products as soon as possible and instead use SHA-2 or SHA-3. 
Replacing SHA-1 is urgent where it is used for digital signatures.
