*History: 

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, 
	is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext 
	is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
