*History:

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as 
	standardized sequences of two different signal durations, 
	called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.
Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.

International Morse Code, also known as Continental Morse Code, 
	encodes the 26 English letters A through Z, some non-English letters, 
	the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals (prosigns). 

There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. 
Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots and dashes.
